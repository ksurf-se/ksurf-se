      heading: Explore kitesurfing paradise and make friends for life!
      pitch: |
        Dakhla is south Morocco's kitesurfing paradise!

        White sand beaches, a windy turquoise lagoon and ocean with waves offer dream conditions for surfing & kiting!<br/>
        Spend a week or two surrounded by our experienced team and friendly people all of share the same passion.

        In a spot with endless space and conditions for any kiting discipline.

      weather: |
        Warm & sunny weather and an average air temperatures around 22°C, with a bit cooler evenings.

        Perfect thermal winds are created due to cold nights and quick heating of land compared to water during the day,
        building up to 20 knots (11m/s) and more throughout the day.

        The water is usyally between 16 and 20°C, bring the water wear of your choice. We recommend a long 2/3mm or 3/4mm wetsuit.

        #### Accommodation
        We will stay at the best camp in Dakhla. The hotel is located on the Dakhla lagoon, 100 metres from the shore
        between the ocean and the desert. Relax and enjoy breathtaking experiences of south Morocco.

        Dakhla Club Hotel & Spa offers comfortable accommodation right at the lagoon and the kitespot. <br/>

        #### Food
        La Table du Capitaine restaurant pays tribute to healthy and delicious dining.  <br/>
        Its local and Mediterranean flavours create delicious fusions between the land and the sea.
        Meals are served as a buffet in the main part of the restaurant which opens onto the lagoon and is
        filled with the bright sounds of birdsong. At sunset, everyone recharges their batteries under nine majestic
        chandeliers in simple earth-like shapes. <br/>
        Highly symbolic.

        All your meals during the stay at Dakhla Club Hotel & Spa are included in the price. <br/>
        3 delicious healthy meals will be served daily. But please let us know if you have any specific dietary requirements.

      activities: |
        A huge lagoon in the shape of a lunar crescent with reliable thermal winds blowing across the bay make this a stunning
        playground with plenty of space for everybody. Dakhla offers conditions for every level and all water based activities.
        Perfectly flat water, waist deep locations and great waves just beyond the foreland.

        During your stay in Dakhla, you can practice kitesurfing, surf, fish, mountain bike, relax in the Spa or on the beach. <br/>
        If you are a surfer you can venture to the surf spot, and when the spot is flat without wind, take a stand up paddle board
