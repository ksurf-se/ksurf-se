    q: What is wind warranty for kitesurfing lessons?
    a: |
      We cannot control nature. This is why we have the so called  “wind warranty” on all our kite courses.

      Wind warranty means:

      If you somehow can not complete all or part of your practical kite course because of the wind,
      you will have the opportunity to complete the course during the season and throughout the coming season without additional cost.
      We have an optional offer if you're living in, or will be visiting Stockholm.
      You will be able to finish your lessons with our cooperating kite school in Stockholm.
      You will get a voucher which will be valid one year.

      Wind warranty applies when:

      - The theoretical parts of the lesson have been completed, and we cannot proceed with pratical parts of the lesson.
      - The wind is too weak or too strong.
      - It stops blowing, or that it decreases so that it is not possible to fly a kite.
      - The wind increases and it starts to blow too much to fly a kite.
      - The wind is extremely gusty.
